Project Description-

For a given Relation (Table) with given attributes and set of FDs, I have identified the keys and checked the highest normal form it satisfies. 

If the highest NF is x then the program suggests appropriate decomposition to take it to the (x+1) (NF Only up to BCNF NF).

The program also identifies the keys for the decomposed relations.
